    "\n",
    "There are two challenges in this notebook for you to tackle. Each one will test your knowledge of Python to now. While they will be challenges, they are not challenges that will be impossible for you. You know everything you need to know in order to complete these challenges, save one portion which I will give you a guide to get you through. \n",

    "## Premise of the Guessing Game\n",
    "1. Python generates a random secret number between 1-20.\n",
    "1. The player has 5 tries to guess the secret number (a 25% chance to guess it correctly).\n",
    "1. After each player guess, Python tells the player if the player's guess is higher or lower than the secret number. \n",
    "1. The game ends when\n",
    "    1. the player uses all five tries without a correct guess or\n",
    "    1. the player guesses the correct number.\n",

    "## Scoring\n",
    "- If the player guesses the secret number in 1 try, they receive 5 points.\n",
    "- If the player guesses the secret number in 2 tries, they receive 4 points.\n",
    "- If the player guesses the secret number in 3 tries, they receive 3 points.\n",
    "- If the player guesses the secret number in 4 tries, they receive 2 points.\n",
    "- If the player guesses the secret number in 5 tries, they receive 1 point.\n",
    "- If the player does not guess the secret number, they receive 0 points. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fewer tries to correctly guess the secret number, the higher the player scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "## At the End of each Game\n",
    "At the end of each game, the following is recorded to a DataFrame:\n",
    "- Player's name\n",
    "- Game number for that player\n",
    "- Player's score\n",
    "- Secret number for that game\n",
    "\n",
    "## At the End of all of the Player's Games\n",

    "- That player's highest score\n",
    "- That player's lowest score\n",
    "- That player's median score\n",

    "## For a bit more of a challenge\n",
    "For a bit more of a challenge, if the same player plays again, the Python picks up where the player left off and adds any additional game score to the player's overall score. And reflect this in the chart for that player. "
